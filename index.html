            <br>
            Built a log-in system using C++ coding language allowing users to create an account by inputting a unique username
            and a password. Administrative options allow access to a list of all the users in the system.

            <span style="float:left"><b>Text Generator | Java</b></span>
            <br>
            Built a text generator with three different models: deterministic, probabilistic, and random. The model was trained by reading in a text file
            of any size. Users would start with typing in four command-line arguments: the text file used to train the generate algorithm, seed word, number
            of words to be output, and which text generation model to use.</br>
